# KeyLogger Project

> Capture and forward keystrokes in real time from a client machine to a local Flask server via HTTP POST. Utilises Pythonâ€™s `pynput`, `requests`, and `Flask` for seamless logging. Ideal for research or auditingâ€”use responsibly.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project comprises two main components:

1. **Keylogger Source** (`keylog.py`, `post.py`):
   - Captures keystrokes on the client machine using `pynput`.
   - Buffers and sends strokes to a remote server via `post.py`.
   - Appends captured input to `strokes.txt` locally for backup.

2. **Server Trial** (`server.py`, `postingdata.py`):
   - Hosts a lightweight Flask server to receive keystroke payloads.
   - Processes and logs incoming data to `strokes.txt` in real time.
